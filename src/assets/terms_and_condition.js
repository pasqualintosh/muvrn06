        <h2 class="intro-header"><em>Art.3 - </em>Objectives</h2>
        <p>The game is enabled by the mobile app and runs very easily.
            <br> You earn points every time you move in a sustainable way: walking, cycling, using public transport or sharing your vehicle with other users (carpooling).
            <br> The more points you earn, the more you will be able to raise the attention of local partners who will offer rewards and discounts to have you as their urban mobility testimonial.
            <br> All the data collected are anonymised and shared with the local administrations of reference to provide a support tool for the implementation of urban sustainable mobility policies. In addition, some of the data collected, once anonymized, are made available to the community in an aggregate way (so-called Open Data).
            <br> MUV embraces the whole community, allowing citizens to play in tournaments, challenges and missions to encourage them to adopt more sustainable and healthy mobility habits, public and private organisations to improve their relationship with users/clients and local administrators to design more effective urban policies.
            <br> By offering rewards and discounts, public and private organisations that are partners of the MUV initiative become supporters of athletes, teams and tournaments.
            <br> For them MUV is an innovative communication system to reach users and customers through a message of social and environmental responsibility.
            <br> Rather than focusing on complex and expensive infrastructural interventions, MUV promotes a change towards more sustainable mobility decisions and behaviors by directly involving local communities, companies and political decision-makers.
