As a NEWBIE, each week you’ll play a WEEKLY CHALLENGE among your friends, your neighbours and the whole world community and if you’ll reach the top 3, you’ll get rewarded with trophies and medals. Meanwhile, you can improve your skills by completing the TRAINING SESSIONS, the only way to level up and became ROOKIE, PRO and finally STAR. From time to time, if you play well, SPECIAL TRAINING SESSIONS might appear: if you enrol and complete them you’ll obtain real gifts. No virtual badges. Real stuff. By reaching higher levels, you’ll be selected to represent your city in the CITY TOURNAMENT, you’ll be able to join a team and try your hand at the TEAM TOURNAMENT and experience other amazing game dynamics we co-designed together with more than 150 people from 6 different cities in Europe.",

As a NEWBIE, each week you’ll play a WEEKLY CHALLENGE among your friends, your neighbours and the whole world community and if you’ll reach the top 3, you’ll get rewarded with trophies and medals. Meanwhile, you can improve your skills by completing the TRAINING SESSIONS, the only way to level up and became ROOKIE, PRO and finally STAR. From time to time, if you play well, SPECIAL TRAINING SESSIONS might appear: if you enrol and complete them you’ll obtain real gifts. No virtual badges. Real stuff. By reaching higher levels, you’ll be selected to represent your city in the CITY TOURNAMENT, you’ll be able to join a team and try your hand at the TEAM TOURNAMENT and experience other amazing game dynamics we co-designed together with more than 150 people from 6 different cities in Europe.",

      "¿Como funciona? El juego es simple, obtienes puntos cada vez que te mueves de manera sostenible: caminar, andar en bicicleta o usar el transporte público. Al igual que en los deportes, cuanto más juegas, más rápido subirás de nivel (de Newbie a Star) y más atención recibirás de los patrocinadores. Como NEWBIE, cada semana podras jugar al RETO SEMANAL entre tus amigos, tus vecinos y toda la comunidad mundial y, si llegas al top 3, serás recompensado con trofeos y medallas. Mientras tanto, puedes mejorar tus habilidades completando las SESIONES DE ENTRENAMIENTO, la única forma de subir de nivel y convertirte en ROOKIE, PRO y finalmente STAR. De vez en cuando, si juegas bien, pueden aparecer SESIONES ESPECIALES DE ENTRENAMIENTO: si te inscribes y completas, obtendrás regalos reales. Sin insignias virtuales. Premios reales. Al alcanzar niveles más altos, podrás ser seleccionado para representar a tu CIUDAD en un TORNEO, podrás unirte a un equipo y probarte en los TORNEOS POR EQUIPOS y experimentar otras increíbles dinámicas de juego que co-diseñamos junto con más de 150 personas de 6 ciudades diferentes en Europa.",

      "How does it work? The game is simple, you get points every time you move in a sustainable way: walking, biking or using public transportation. As in sports, the more you play, the faster you level up (from Newbie to Star) and the higher attention you get from sponsors. As a NEWBIE, each week you’ll play a WEEKLY CHALLENGE among your friends, your neighbours and the whole world community and if you’ll reach the top 3, you’ll get rewarded with trophies and medals. Meanwhile, you can improve your skills by completing the TRAINING SESSIONS, the only way to level up and became ROOKIE, PRO and finally STAR. From time to time, if you play well, SPECIAL TRAINING SESSIONS might appear: if you enrol and complete them you’ll obtain real gifts. No virtual badges. Real stuff. By reaching higher levels, you’ll be selected to represent your city in the CITY TOURNAMENT, you’ll be able to join a team and try your hand at the TEAM TOURNAMENT and experience other amazing game dynamics we co-designed together with more than 150 people from 6 different cities in Europe.",

      "How does it work? The game is simple, you get points every time you move in a sustainable way: walking, biking or using public transportation. As in sports, the more you play, the faster you level up (from Newbie to Star) and the higher attention you get from sponsors. As a NEWBIE, each week you’ll play a WEEKLY CHALLENGE among your friends, your neighbours and the whole world community and if you’ll reach the top 3, you’ll get rewarded with trophies and medals. Meanwhile, you can improve your skills by completing the TRAINING SESSIONS, the only way to level up and became ROOKIE, PRO and finally STAR. From time to time, if you play well, SPECIAL TRAINING SESSIONS might appear: if you enrol and complete them you’ll obtain real gifts. No virtual badges. Real stuff. By reaching higher levels, you’ll be selected to represent your city in the CITY TOURNAMENT, you’ll be able to join a team and try your hand at the TEAM TOURNAMENT and experience other amazing game dynamics we co-designed together with more than 150 people from 6 different cities in Europe.",

As in sports, the more you play, the faster you level up (from Newbie to Star) and the higher attention you get from sponsors. As a NEWBIE, each week you’ll play a WEEKLY CHALLENGE among your friends, your neighbours and the whole world community and if you’ll reach the top 3, you’ll get rewarded with trophies and medals. Meanwhile, you can improve your skills by completing the TRAINING SESSIONS, the only way to level up and became ROOKIE, PRO and finally STAR. From time to time, if you play well, SPECIAL TRAINING SESSIONS might appear: if you enrol and complete them you’ll obtain real gifts. No virtual badges. Real stuff. By reaching higher levels, you’ll be selected to represent your city in the CITY TOURNAMENT, you’ll be able to join a team and try your hand at the TEAM TOURNAMENT and experience other amazing game dynamics we co-designed together with more than 150 people from 6 different cities in Europe.",

      "Com funciona? El joc és sencill, gunayes punts cada vegada que et mous de manera sostenible: caminar, anar en bicicleta o fer servir el transport públic. Igual que en els esports, com més jugues, més ràpid pujaràs de nivell (de Newbie a Star) i més atenció rebràs dels patrocinadors. Com NEWBIE, cada setmana podràs jugar al REPTE SETMANAL entre els amics, els veïns i tota la comunitat mundial i, si arribes al top 3, seràs recompensat amb trofeus i medalles. Mentrestant, pots millorar les teves habilitats completant les SESSIONS D'ENTRENAMENT, l'única forma de pujar de nivell i convertir-te en ROOKIE, PRO i finalment STAR. De tant en tant, si jugues bé, poden aparèixer SESSIONS ESPECIALS D'ENTRENAMENT: si t'inscrius i completes, obtindràs regals reals. Sense insígnies virtuals. Premis reals. A l'aconseguir nivells més alts, podràs ser seleccionat per representar a la teva ciutat en un TORNEIG entre CIUTATS, podràs unir-te a un equip i provar en els TORNEJOS PER EQUIPS i experimentar altres increïbles dinàmiques de joc que co-dissenyar juntament amb més de 150 persones de 6 ciutats diferents a Europa.",

MUV promou un canvi de comportament cap a opcions de mobilitat més responsables, saludables i sostenibles, involucrant a nivell local i de manera positiva a comunitats, negocis, gestors de la mobilitat i responsables socials i polítics. Jugant amb MUV produiràs dades. Aquestes dades, de forma anònima i agregada, estaran en obert a disposició del teu municipi i de tots els ciutadans. Això fomenta el debat sobre la mobilitat activa i encoratja als planificadors urbans a dissenyar polítiques urbanes més efectives dirigides directament al ciutadà (i no als automòbils).",

      "Wie funktioniert es? Das Spiel ist einfach. Du bekommst jedes Mal Punkte, wenn du dich auf eine nachhaltige Weise bewegst: zu Fuß, mit dem Fahrrad oder mit öffentlichen Verkehrsmitteln. Wie im Sport, je mehr du spielst, desto schneller steigst du auf (vom Anfänger bis zum Star) und desto mehr Aufmerksamkeit bekommst du von Sponsoren. Als NEULING spielst du jede Woche eine WEEKLY CHALLENGE mit deinen Freunden, deinen Nachbarn und der ganzen Welt. Wenn du die Top 3 erreichst, wirst du mit Trophäen und Medaillen belohnt. In der Zwischenzeit kannst du deine Fähigkeiten verbessern, indem du die TRAININGSEINHEITEN absolvierst. Dies ist der einzige Weg, um dich zu verbessern und zum ANFÄNGER, PROFI und schließlich STAR zu werden. Von Zeit zu Zeit, können SPEZIELLE TRAININGSSITZUNGEN erscheinen: wenn du dich anmeldest und sie abschließt, erhältst du echte Geschenke. Keine virtuellen Abzeichen. Echte Sachen. Wenn du höhere Levels erreichst, wirst du ausgewählt, deine Stadt im STADTTURNIER zu vertreten, du kannst einem Team beitreten und dich beim MANNSCHAFTSTURNIER versuchen und andere erstaunliche Spieldynamiken erleben, die wir gemeinsam mit mehr als 150 Personen aus sechs verschiedenen Städten Europas entwickelt haben.",

MUV fördert einen Wandel hin zu verantwortungsbewussteren und gesünderen Mobilitätsentscheidungen, indem es die lokalen Gemeinschaften, lokalen Unterstützungsorganisationen und politischen Entscheidungsträger positiv einbezieht. Indem du MUV spielst, produzierst du Daten. Diese Daten werden deiner Gemeinde in anonymer und aggregierter Form zur Verfügung gestellt. Dies fördert die Debatte über aktive Mobilität und ermutigt die Stadtplaner, effektivere (autounabhängige) Stadtpolitiken zu entwickeln. Offene Datensätze werden ebenfalls freigegeben.",
