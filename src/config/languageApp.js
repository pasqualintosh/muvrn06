      "There are two main reasons for this:\n1. MUV trips are validated segment by segment and then, when you press STOP, with a final validation process. If it finds inaccuracies or conflicting data then it may not consider some segments valid and thus reduce the total number of points awarded for the trip.\n2. Each user has a certain number of ideal kms to cover in a sustainable way every day for each transit mode. When this threshold is reached, the point conversion algorithm becomes less rewarding. If you have already done several trips today, it is possible that you already reached this level.",

You pressed STOP when you were not yet close enough to work or home.\n3. You made inaccuracies when you uploaded your routinary home-work trip.\nIn the latter case you can go to the 'Frequent trips\" section of the side menu and eventually edit the starting and ending point of your frequent trip.",

Ogni utente ha un certo numero di km ideali da coprire in un modo sostenibile ogni giorno per ogni modalità di spostamento.
