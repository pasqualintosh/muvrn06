It is divided into 4 levels (Newbie, Rookie, Pro and Star) and each level consists of 4 training sessions.\nIn the ACTIVE section you can see the session currently active and which events you need to complete to finalise it. Once a training session is over, you will be rewarded with some coins and move on to the next one.\nOnce you have completed all the sessions within one level, you will get to the next level.\nWhile the first sessions are free, the following ones have a cost. To unlock them you will have to pay a certain amount of coins."
